This is a URL Shortener written in Java with the only purpose to create shortened urls, which are stored in a Redis-Database.
The shortened links can then be used to provide a simpler access to complicated URLs.

It comes with authentication support.
Only admins are allowed to create or delete short links.

== Installation

You need a JDK and Gradle for this project.

As a requirement a Redis-Database is necessary.
Start one with

    docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

Then start the application:

    gradle bootRun

== Usage

Open the landing page http://localhost:8080. You now need to login as an admin.
The credentials are defined in the
link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties].

In the admin menu you can add new short links.

Then you can get redirected by querying the following address:
http://localhost:8080/<your-short-link>

== Docker

We automatically build a docker image for shorty.
Find it here:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cmeter/url-shortener

== Deployment

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file to create a production build.
Please copy and edit `skeleton.env` to your needs and save it as `production.env`

The application then starts a redis server, which persists the data and exposes port 5007 for further access.
